### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

May here, I am an aspiring Software Engineer. Just started my coding journey Feb this year. Previously I was from the logistics, operation and warehouse sector, my curiosity of how technology has been assisting us in our daily lives has inspired me to start my coding journey

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently wireframing a new project (NEL MRT Toilets) inspired by [NSL MRT Toliets](https://www.thevitalproject.com/restroom?source=window&redirected=true). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js and SQL.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for advice on better and more efficient codes, CSS styling and career advices.
