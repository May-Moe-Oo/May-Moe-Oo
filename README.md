### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a curious person who loves exploring something new and different. Since Tech has become a new essential in life, I started my coding journey Feb this year to learn more about web dev. Which had given me a window view of the tech sector and its importance. I am inspired to be a part of this technology industry and contribute to projects that can improve user's daily lives. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently wireframing a new project (NEL MRT Toilets) inspired by [NSL MRT Toliets](https://www.thevitalproject.com/restroom?source=window&redirected=true). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL to improve my analytical skills.
- ðŸ¤” If you have any professional or career advice or just want to chat reach out to me www.linkedin.com/in/may-moe-oo 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't drink coffee! Just water, juices and sometimes iced lemon tea. I have two 14 years old cats ðŸ˜½
